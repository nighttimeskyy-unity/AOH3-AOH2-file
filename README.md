# AOH3-AOH2-file

Takes provincePoints data converters, it back to TXT format


YOU NEED A VALID JSON FILE TO USE IT!


You Need .NET 8.0 Runtime Installed to Use It

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0


This Tool is Pretty Much Outdated since AOH2 isn't Going to ever get Updated

But it Can Be Used to fix the Importing of Provinces in AOH3


THIS TOOL WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE UPDATES OR EVER BE UPDATED

Don't ask for updates for it
